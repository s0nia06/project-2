                We often treat young people as incapable of deep, introspective thought.
                But instead of completely and weighing them down with an expectation of greatness,
                it is important for children to access spaces where they can cultivate their 
                artistic passion alongside peers and independent of censorship. The Scribble Society 
                is a forum where young creatives can publish their work and view works made by peers 
                who share the samepassions. Get inspired and find resources to dive into creating your 
                next masterpiece.
